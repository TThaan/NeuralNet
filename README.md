# NeuralNet
 Learning/Visualization Tool for the processes of creating neural nets (C#, WPF)

This app is not completed but fundamentally working, including bugs.
It's meant to be a learning tool not to actually create neural nets for applications. It's just way too slow. 
Its purpose is to visualize the (mathematical) processes in initializing and training a neural net. 
Many functions are not implemented yet, e.g.
· visualize the relevant paths in feeding forward input
· display the formulas and results of each step 
· different algorithms for initializing the net and computing the loss
· biases (existing in UI but missing in back propagation)
· different kinds of neural networks
· train & test split, but no validation (finding hyper parameters) yet

The UI is for debugging. Not sure I' gonna invest much effort into beautifying it. 
Actually I'm planning to make a web version but not soon.
